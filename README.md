## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a **from-scratch ERC-4337 Account Abstraction implementation** designed to expose how the protocol works internally.

The goal is **not SDK abstraction**, but a deep dive into:
- 📦 **UserOperation** construction and packing.
- 🔐 **Smart account validation** logic.
- 🔄 **EntryPoint** execution flow.
- ⛽ **Gas sponsorship** via Paymasters.
- 🔑 **Session-based** authorization.

This project mirrors how **bundlers and wallets** interact with ERC-4337 on production networks using `v0.7` standards.

## 📚 What is Account Abstraction?

In traditional Ethereum, Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are rigid. **Account Abstraction (AA)** moves authorization and validation logic from the protocol level into smart contracts.

| Feature | Traditional EOA | Smart Account (AA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Control** | Single Private Key | Arbitrary Logic (Multi-sig, Social Recovery) |
| **Gas Payment** | ETH only | ETH, ERC-20, or Sponsored (Gasless) |
| **Security** | Seed Phrase Risk | Session Keys, Spending Limits |
| **Upgradability** | Impossible | Possible (via Proxies) |

### What does this repo show?
1. A minimal EVM **"Smart Wallet"** using the `EntryPoint` contract.
2. Handling `validateUserOp` manually.
3. Integration with **Paymasters** for gas sponsorship.

---

## ⚙️ Why ERC-4337?

ERC-4337 is the industry standard for Account Abstraction because it achieves AA **without modifying the Ethereum consensus layer** (no hard fork required).

- **Alternative Mempool:** UserOps are sent to a separate mempool.
- **Bundlers:** Special nodes bundle UserOps into standard Ethereum transactions.
- **EntryPoint:** A singleton contract that coordinates validation and execution.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Flow

The flow of a transaction in this repository follows the standard ERC-4337 lifecycle.

    Bundler -->|Call handleOps| EP[EntryPoint Contract]
    EP -->|1. Validate| SA[Smart Account]
    EP -->|2. Check Gas| PM[Paymaster Optional]
    EP -->|3. Execute| SA

## 🧩 Key Components

### SmartAccount

`SmartAccount.sol` implements the `IAccount` interface. It is responsible for:

1. **Nonce Management:** Preventing replay attacks.
2. **Signature Validation:** Verifying the signer matches the owner (or a valid session key).
3. **Execution:** Calling the target contract if validation passes.

### Session Keys

Implemented in `SessionKeyManager.sol`. Session keys allow users to generate a temporary key with **restricted permissions** (e.g., "Can only interact with Uniswap for the next 2 hours"). This improves UX by removing the need for constant wallet pop-ups.

### Paymaster

`SimplePaymaster.sol` implements the `IPaymaster` interface.

* **Purpose:** Decouples the sender from the gas payer.
* **Mechanism:** The Paymaster deposits ETH into the EntryPoint. When a UserOp is executed, the EntryPoint deducts gas costs from the Paymaster's balance instead of the Smart Account.

## 🚀 Usage & Scripts

This project uses **Foundry** for all deployments and simulations.

### Prerequisites

* [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/NexTechArchitect/ERC4337-Account-Abstraction-Foundry.git](https://github.com/NexTechArchitect/ERC4337-Account-Abstraction-Foundry.git)
cd ERC4337-Account-Abstraction-Foundry
forge install

```

### Build & Test

```bash
forge build
forge test

```

### Deployment & Execution

We use Solidity scripts to simulate the Bundler behavior.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make deploy` | Deploys contracts and runs the full flow. |
| `make fix` | Retries the transaction using existing contracts (Saves Gas). |
| `make balance` | Checks the wallet balance. |
